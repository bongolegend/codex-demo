This is a simple Fastify server written in TypeScript.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` - run the development server with ts-node
- `npm run build` - compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm start` - run the compiled JavaScript from `dist`

The server exposes a single route at `/` that returns `{"message": "Hello World"}`.
